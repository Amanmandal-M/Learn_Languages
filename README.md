# Multi-Language Development Environment Setup

This guide will help you set up your development environment for C++, JavaScript, and Python.

## C++

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- Code Editor/IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

### Setup

1. Install a C++ compiler based on your operating system.
   - On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install g++
     ```
   - On macOS (with Homebrew):
     ```bash
     brew install gcc
     ```
   - On Windows:
     Download and install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/).

2. Install a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## JavaScript

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (JavaScript runtime)
- Code Editor/IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

### Setup

1. Install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/).

2. Verify the installation by running the following commands:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   
## Python

### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Code Editor/IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

### Setup
1. Install Python 3 from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Verify the installation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 --version

### Read This :

In this example, there are three sections for C++, JavaScript, and Python, respectively. Each section includes the prerequisites and setup instructions for that specific programming language. You can customize the instructions further based on your specific needs or include additional information if required.
